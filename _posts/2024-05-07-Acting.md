I whinge everytime people treat and show you that you aren't important in their lives but their subtle actions say otherwise. 

I mean I don't even look that hard at these things but where there's smoke, there's fire. 

Was I really not worth showing that I'm appreciated? 

It's the sole reason why I isolated myself from everyone. I can no longer trust everyone to be themselves.
