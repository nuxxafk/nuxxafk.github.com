title: "It's midnight"

It's midnight. Admittedly. I'm a bit tired. 
Recent catastrophic events have been contributing to my restlessness. 
What should I do? 
Really felt like my energy levels went from 26 to 0. 
Want to play, want to finish another project.. want to automate another process. 
I can't seem to even sleep properly now. 
Every weekday seems like a chore. Pretty much running on 3 hours of sleep. 
I don't know.. is it back? I don't know.  

Man i'm so tired.. 
I've got to sleep.
