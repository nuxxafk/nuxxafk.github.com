Lilac is such a beautiful color. Along with any shades of violet or purple. It's just goddamn pleasing to see! I see why people love these. 


Anyway, I've always wished for you in everywhere we go. But like reality is it's most likely not granted. But I held that to a degree that it kept me going. 

I still wish for you at night though, hoping it will be somehow granted before the sun of reality rises up. 

I do hope it can be granted in this life. Where it be different reincarnations of us or whatever. 
I think you are different than the other people I have met, and to this day, I never seem to figure out why. 
Maybe as time goes by and everything gets diluted, I will. 

But now, I can only admire and wish from afar.

Hoping you'll somehow bless me with your moonlight beams and keep me going until the end of my days. 

Love, 
ruko
